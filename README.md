# hexapo-robot-with-rl is my undergraduate thesis presented at UNIFESP in aug/21. This project proposed a reinforcement learning algorithm with duple reward (static and dynamic)
while finding a path to an agent walk through in a grid. The project resulted in a algorithm which can be +3000% more efficient than the classic solution.
